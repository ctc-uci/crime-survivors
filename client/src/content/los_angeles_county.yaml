  desc: 'Surviving a violent crime is difficult, and while the crime may only have taken
seconds or minutes, the healing process can take quite a while. The road traveled
in the aftermath is slightly different for everyone, but we all need help and
understanding along the way. It will be important for you to find support during
your healing process. Talk with friends, family, a therapist, a support group or other
survivors in the Connect Directory section of the National Center for Victims of
Crime Website at http://www.victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims.
If you need immediate help, you may want to call a hotline for anonymous support.

  title: A Message
  desc: 'Healing won’t happen quickly, but it will happen. It is within your power to facilitate
the process and begin your journey to a new place of happiness and peace. Here are
some suggestions:
• Recognize your loss.
• Honor your feelings and recognize your right to feel the way you do.
• Talk about your feelings to those you trust.
• Connect with other survivors of violence and talk about your experience.
• Don’t be afraid to seek out professional help if you are struggling. None of us
can do it alone.
• Recognize triggers that take you back to the memory and the fear.
• Be patient and don’t make rash decisions — it takes time to figure out where
you are, where you want to be, and how to get there.
• Take care of yourself — try to exercise, eat right, and sleep well.
• Don’t abandon hope — believe that healing can and will take place.'
