  title: ~
  desc: "9-1-1 is the number to call to get help in a police, fire or medical emergency. 9-1-1 calls
go over dedicated phone lines to the 9-1-1 answering point closest to the caller, and
trained personnel then send the emergency help needed.
9-1-1 should only be used in emergency situations. An emergency is any situation
that requires immediate assistance from the law enforcement, the fire department
or an ambulance. If you are ever in doubt of whether a situation is an emergency
you should call 9-1-1. It’s better to be safe and let the 9-1-1 call taker determine if you
need emergency assistance.
If you call 9-1-1 by mistake, do not hang up. Tell the call taker what happened so they
know there really isn’t an emergency."

  desc: "On November 4, 2008, the people of the State of California approved Proposition
9, the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law. This measure amended the
California Constitution to provide additional rights to victims. This card contains
specific sections of the Victims’ Bill of Rights and resources. Crime victims may obtain
additional information regarding Marsy’s Law and local Victim Witness Assistance
Center information by contacting the Attorney General’s Victim Services Unit at
1-877-433-9069.
A ‘victim’ is defined under the California Constitution as “a person who suffers direct
or threatened physical, psychological, or financial harm as a result of the commission
or attempted commission of a crime or delinquent act. The term ‘victim’ also
includes the person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, or guardian, and includes
a lawful representative of a crime victim who is deceased, a minor, or physically or
psychologically incapacitated. The term ‘victim’ does not include a person in custody
for an offense, the accused, or a person whom the court finds would not act in the
best interests of a minor victim.”
An overview of victim rights, along with helpful resources are listed on a card that
can be printed out from their website at http://ag.ca.gov/victims.php."

to preserve the crime scene - don’t clean up or move anything so that detectives can
collect evidence that will be helpful in bringing your assailant(s) to justice. Then call a
trusted friend or family member who can be with you as you interact with the police,
physicians, and investigators to make personal decisions. In the days following, you
should consider finding a counselor to help you cope with the trauma and the effects
of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)."

- category: Document the Crime
  title: ~
  desc: "While it may be the last thing you want to do, it is very important to write down
exactly what happened as soon as possible following your incident. The best way to
protect your memory is to document the event before being interviewed. Writing
down what has taken place will be a source you can revisit to remember details. This
will be very important if you need to testify later. A written account can also help
to validate your feelings as you walk through the healing process. Below are some
things you should include in your written description.
• THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT: Step by step, record what happened. If you
were assaulted, how? What was said by whom, and how it was said? Include
how you came to a place of safety and which direction your perpetrator(s)
may have been headed.
• STOLEN ITEMS: A detailed list
of any items that were stolen
from you will help the police
investigation and may be needed
for insurance purposes. The
location and context of the crime
— Write down where the crime
occurred as well as important
landmarks or other notable
information, such as the presence
of any potential witnesses.
• THE TIME OF THE CRIME: As
accurately as possible, record
when the crime took place, as
well as any warning signs you
may recall.
• A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR
ASSAILANT(S): Describe hair
color and style, eye color, shape of face, height, weight, voice, clothing,
tattoos, or other identifying marks.
• DESCRIPTION OF OTHER ITEMS: Recall any items that may have been used
during the crime, such as a handgun or a vehicle."

- category: Protect Yourself Against Further Harm
  title: ~
  desc: "If your home was burglarized or if you had your wallet or purse stolen, you may feel the
need to have your home checked before returning to it. Ask the police to check your
home for you and to make sure you arrive there safely. You may want or need to have
someone with you when you arrive home for a while, especially if your perpetrator isn’t
caught immediately.
It will be important for you to re-establish a sense of safety in your life again, which
may not come easily at first. Some survivors of violent crime feel the need for security
devices or weapons. Generally, the best protection you have is to be aware of your
surroundings and what your “gut” is telling you. It is important to know what you feel
comfortable with and what will help you to be and feel safe"

- category: Short-Term Planning
  title: ~
  desc: "You may feel bombarded with countless details and decisions in the aftermath
of a violent encounter — and to make matters worse, you are probably in shock.
It will take time to deal with everything, but here are a few suggestions for the
short-term:
• Call your employer or have a friend call if you cannot return to work right
away. Remember that you just survived a serious trauma and even if you
weren’t physically hurt, you may need some time away from work to cope.
• Notify your health insurance company or primary care provider so that you
will be covered for your medical care and counseling needs. If you have lost
a loved one, you or a friend should notify the life insurance company.
• Cancel your credit cards if they were stolen. This will hopefully prevent
some headaches with your bills and can also lead to the apprehension of
the person who may be using them.
• Learn about the investigation of your case from law enforcement. Ask them
what they will be doing, what the process is, how you will be notified and
anything else that you may want to know about the process of trying to find
your perpetrator(s).
• Let family and friends know what has happened so that they can
understand that you’ve been through a trauma and that you will need their
support. It is often difficult for others to understand what living through
such a trauma is like. More information for family and friends can be found
on page 31."
