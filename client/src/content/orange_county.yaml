seconds or minutes, the healing process can take quite a while. The road traveled
in the aftermath is slightly different for everyone, but we all need help and
understanding along the way. It will be important for you to find support during

  desc: 'Serving Survivors of Domestic Violence
The focus of the Anaheim Family Justice Center is to co-locate as many resources as
possible to effectively and efficiently address domestic violence, child abuse, elder/
dependent adult abuse, and sexual assault. By utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach
to intervene in the vicious cycle of family and sex crimes, the Center will create new and
innovative ways to support, contribute to, and enhance provision of crime victim services.
Goals and Objectives
Provide a safe, welcoming environment where victims of domestic violence, child abuse,
elder abuse, and sexual assault can go for support and services.
Provide multi-disciplinary teams which consist of detectives, victim advocates, prosecuting
attorneys and other social service providers as appropriate. The teams will work together
to ensure client safety, help clients to access needed services and provide support for the
investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.
“Vertically prosecute” criminal cases. “Vertical Prosecution” allows the victim to deal with
a single, prosecutor committed to handing the criminal case from start to finish.
Increase awareness and understanding of domestic violence, child abuse, elder or
dependant adult abuse, and sexual assault issues through educational programs
conducted by police detectives, victim advocates, and trained volunteers. This training
will be offered to members of the community, and “in-house” to personnel who deal with
family crimes and sexual assault cases. The programs will focus on prevention of abuse,
and prosecution of cases.
Prevent and fight domestic abuse, neglect, and exploitation of at-risk children, elder &
disabled adults in the City of Anaheim though public awareness programs designed to
make the citizens of Anaheim cognizant of the signs o'

  title: A Message
  desc: 'Mission: Human Options provides safe haven and life changing programs to help
abused women, their children and families rebuild their lives – and works with the
community to break the cycle of domestic violence.
For assistance with domestic violence issues or information about our shelter and
programs, please call our 24-hour hotline at (877) 854-3594. If you are in imminent
danger or have a physical emergency, please call 911. Someone is available 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year to answer your questions and provide assistance. A 30-45
minute intake with our hotline advocate is required before entering our shelter.
Primary languages: English, Spanish, and Farsi. Translation services available for
other languages.
Our emergency shelter is for any individual or family in a domestic violence situation
seeking shelter. Each family has their own room and single men or women without
children may share a room. Participants are provided the opportunity to receive
individual counseling from a skilled therapist, participate in group counseling and
therapeutic sessions, and work with a case manager in order to navigate available
services en route to discovering a way forward. Legal advocacy services including
monthly family law clinics with a pro bono attorney are also available. Children of
all ages participate in the children’s program where they receive age appropriate
counseling and therapeutic activities.

Transitional Housing
Families who have completed a domestic violence shelter program can apply
for Second Step, our transitional housing program. Here, families regain their
independence by participating in educational and job skill building activities as
well as continuing counseling and case management sessions. Children have the
opportunity to participate in the children’s programs and have access to after
school tutoring. In 2014, 82% of women completing our transitional housing
program increased their income and 90% secured permanent housing.

Center for Children and Families
This community resource center provides intervention for men, women, and
children who are survivors of domestic violence or who are currently in an abusive
relationship. Any individual affected by domestic violence in Orange County or
the surrounding area may have access to counseling, legal advocacy, education, or
support groups.
Services include: Counseling for individuals, families, seniors, and children,
Legal advocacy, monthly presentations on Immigration Options for Survivors of
Domestic Violence and Rights and Resources Available to Survivors, free monthly
Immigration and Family Law clinics, Parenting classes, Children’s Empowerment (an
art-focused group for children grades 1-8 focused on expression), Safe Dates—a
teen dating violence curriculum focusing on healthy relationships for middle
and high school students, and Personal Empowerment Program (PEP)- offered in
English and Spanish—a court approved curriculum focused on domestic violence
education. As a result of our therapeutic services, 85% of clients decreased levels of
anxiety and 75% decreased levels of depression in 2014. Additionally, the Center for
Children and Families includes a Safe Options for Seniors Program which focuses
on providing services to adults ages fifty and older as well as dependent adults
who are survivors of domestic violence or late life family violence. Safe Options
for Seniors services include individual counseling, Senior Empowerment Group
(curriculum focused on domestic violence and late life family violence education),
and Journey to Empowerment (an art-based healing group).

Community Education
Community Education at Human Options aims to engage the community in our
mission to reduce and prevent domestic violence. In order to change the societal
attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate the cycle of domestic violence, we place a
priority on prevention programs and awareness campaigns designed to bring
light to an issue that thrives in silence. Our community educators use storytelling,
lecture, and interactive lessons to engage participants of all ages in our mission.
Partnering with Orange County schools, community groups and organizations,
we educate more than 10,000 people a year. If you are interested in learning more
about our free educational opportunities, please e-mail communityeducation@
humanoptions.org or call the Human Options Business Office, Extension 215.'
