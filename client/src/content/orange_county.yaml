  title: ~

go over dedicated phone lines to the 9-1-1 answering point closest to the caller, and
trained personnel then send the emergency help needed.
9-1-1 should only be used in emergency situations. An emergency is any situation
that requires immediate assistance from the law enforcement, the fire department
or an ambulance. If you are ever in doubt of whether a situation is an emergency
you should call 9-1-1. It’s better to be safe and let the 9-1-1 call taker determine if you
need emergency assistance.
If you call 9-1-1 by mistake, do not hang up. Tell the call taker what happened so they
know there really isn’t an emergency.'

  desc: 'On November 4, 2008, the people of the State of California approved Proposition
9, the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law. This measure amended the
California Constitution to provide additional rights to victims. This card contains
specific sections of the Victims’ Bill of Rights and resources. Crime victims may obtain
additional information regarding Marsy’s Law and local Victim Witness Assistance
Center information by contacting the Attorney General’s Victim Services Unit at
1-877-433-9069.
A ‘victim’ is defined under the California Constitution as “a person who suffers direct
or threatened physical, psychological, or financial harm as a result of the commission
or attempted commission of a crime or delinquent act. The term ‘victim’ also
includes the person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, or guardian, and includes
a lawful representative of a crime victim who is deceased, a minor, or physically or
psychologically incapacitated. The term ‘victim’ does not include a person in custody
for an offense, the accused, or a person whom the court finds would not act in the
best interests of a minor victim.”
An overview of victim rights, along with helpful resources are listed on a card that
can be printed out from their website at http://ag.ca.gov/victims.php.'

exactly what happened as soon as possible following your incident. The best way to
protect your memory is to document the event before being interviewed. Writing
down what has taken place will be a source you can revisit to remember details. This
will be very important if you need to testify later. A written account can also help
to validate your feelings as you walk through the healing process. Below are some
things you should include in your written description.
• THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT: Step by step, record what happened. If you
were assaulted, how? What was said by whom, and how it was said? Include
how you came to a place of safety and which direction your perpetrator(s)
may have been headed.
• STOLEN ITEMS: A detailed list
of any items that were stolen
from you will help the police
investigation and may be needed
for insurance purposes. The
location and context of the crime
— Write down where the crime
occurred as well as important
landmarks or other notable
information, such as the presence
of any potential witnesses.
• THE TIME OF THE CRIME: As
accurately as possible, record
when the crime took place, as
well as any warning signs you
may recall.
• A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR
ASSAILANT(S): Describe hair
color and style, eye color, shape of face, height, weight, voice, clothing,
tattoos, or other identifying marks.
• DESCRIPTION OF OTHER ITEMS: Recall any items that may have been used
during the crime, such as a handgun or a vehicle.'

It will be important for you to re-establish a sense of safety in your life again, which
may not come easily at first. Some survivors of violent crime feel the need for security

  title: ~
  desc: 'You may feel bombarded with countless details and decisions in the aftermath of a
violent encounter — and to make matters worse, you are probably in shock. It will
take time to deal with everything, but here are a few suggestions for the short-term:
• Call your employer or have a friend call if you cannot return to work right
away. Remember that you just survived a serious trauma and even if you
weren’t physically hurt, you may need some time away from work to cope.
• Notify your health insurance company or primary care provider so that you
will be covered for your medical care and counseling needs. If you have lost a
loved one, you or a friend should notify the life insurance company.
• Cancel your credit cards if they were stolen. This will hopefully prevent some
headaches with your bills and can also lead to the apprehension of the
person who may be using them.
• Learn about the investigation of your case from law enforcement. Ask them
what they will be doing, what the process is, how you will be notified, and
anything else that you may want to know about the process of trying to find
your perpetrator(s).
• Let family and friends know what has happened so that they can understand
that you’ve been through a trauma and that you will need their support. It is
often difficult for others to understand what living through such a trauma is
like. More information for family and friends can be found in the For Loved
Ones section'

crime since 1978. The staff and trained volunteers provide crisis intervention, basic
needs assistance, support counseling, support through the criminal justice system,

  desc: 'Serving Survivors of Domestic Violence
The focus of the Anaheim Family Justice Center is to co-locate as many resources as
possible to effectively and efficiently address domestic violence, child abuse, elder/
dependent adult abuse, and sexual assault. By utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach
to intervene in the vicious cycle of family and sex crimes, the Center will create new and
innovative ways to support, contribute to, and enhance provision of crime victim services.
Goals and Objectives
Provide a safe, welcoming environment where victims of domestic violence, child abuse,
elder abuse, and sexual assault can go for support and services.
Provide multi-disciplinary teams which consist of detectives, victim advocates, prosecuting
attorneys and other social service providers as appropriate. The teams will work together
to ensure client safety, help clients to access needed services and provide support for the
investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.
“Vertically prosecute” criminal cases. “Vertical Prosecution” allows the victim to deal with
a single, prosecutor committed to handing the criminal case from start to finish.
Increase awareness and understanding of domestic violence, child abuse, elder or
dependant adult abuse, and sexual assault issues through educational programs
conducted by police detectives, victim advocates, and trained volunteers. This training
will be offered to members of the community, and “in-house” to personnel who deal with
family crimes and sexual assault cases. The programs will focus on prevention of abuse,
and prosecution of cases.
Prevent and fight domestic abuse, neglect, and exploitation of at-risk children, elder &
disabled adults in the City of Anaheim though public awareness programs designed to

  desc: 'Mission: Human Options provides safe haven and life changing programs to help
abused women, their children and families rebuild their lives – and works with the
community to break the cycle of domestic violence.
For assistance with domestic violence issues or information about our shelter and
programs, please call our 24-hour hotline at (877) 854-3594. If you are in imminent
danger or have a physical emergency, please call 911. Someone is available 24 hours
a day, 365 days a year to answer your questions and provide assistance. A 30-45
minute intake with our hotline advocate is required before entering our shelter.
Primary languages: English, Spanish, and Farsi. Translation services available for
other languages.
Our emergency shelter is for any individual or family in a domestic violence situation
seeking shelter. Each family has their own room and single men or women without
children may share a room. Participants are provided the opportunity to receive
individual counseling from a skilled therapist, participate in group counseling and
therapeutic sessions, and work with a case manager in order to navigate available
services en route to discovering a way forward. Legal advocacy services including
monthly family law clinics with a pro bono attorney are also available. Children of
all ages participate in the children’s program where they receive age appropriate
counseling and therapeutic activities.

Transitional Housing
Families who have completed a domestic violence shelter program can apply
for Second Step, our transitional housing program. Here, families regain their
independence by participating in educational and job skill building activities as
well as continuing counseling and case management sessions. Children have the
opportunity to participate in the children’s programs and have access to after
school tutoring. In 2014, 82% of women completing our transitional housing
program increased their income and 90% secured permanent housing.

Center for Children and Families
This community resource center provides intervention for men, women, and
children who are survivors of domestic violence or who are currently in an abusive
relationship. Any individual affected by domestic violence in Orange County or
the surrounding area may have access to counseling, legal advocacy, education, or
support groups.
Services include: Counseling for individuals, families, seniors, and children,
Legal advocacy, monthly presentations on Immigration Options for Survivors of
Domestic Violence and Rights and Resources Available to Survivors, free monthly
Immigration and Family Law clinics, Parenting classes, Children’s Empowerment (an
art-focused group for children grades 1-8 focused on expression), Safe Dates—a
teen dating violence curriculum focusing on healthy relationships for middle
and high school students, and Personal Empowerment Program (PEP)- offered in
English and Spanish—a court approved curriculum focused on domestic violence
education. As a result of our therapeutic services, 85% of clients decreased levels of
anxiety and 75% decreased levels of depression in 2014. Additionally, the Center for
Children and Families includes a Safe Options for Seniors Program which focuses
on providing services to adults ages fifty and older as well as dependent adults
who are survivors of domestic violence or late life family violence. Safe Options
for Seniors services include individual counseling, Senior Empowerment Group
(curriculum focused on domestic violence and late life family violence education),
and Journey to Empowerment (an art-based healing group).

Community Education
Community Education at Human Options aims to engage the community in our
mission to reduce and prevent domestic violence. In order to change the societal
attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate the cycle of domestic violence, we place a
priority on prevention programs and awareness campaigns designed to bring
light to an issue that thrives in silence. Our community educators use storytelling,
lecture, and interactive lessons to engage participants of all ages in our mission.
Partnering with Orange County schools, community groups and organizations,
we educate more than 10,000 people a year. If you are interested in learning more
about our free educational opportunities, please e-mail communityeducation@
