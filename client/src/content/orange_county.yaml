crime since 1978. The staff and trained volunteers provide crisis intervention, basic
needs assistance, support counseling, support through the criminal justice system,

    desc: "Serving Survivors of Domestic Violence
The focus of the Anaheim Family Justice Center is to co-locate as many resources as
possible to effectively and efficiently address domestic violence, child abuse, elder/
dependent adult abuse, and sexual assault. By utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach
to intervene in the vicious cycle of family and sex crimes, the Center will create new and
innovative ways to support, contribute to, and enhance provision of crime victim services.
Goals and Objectives
Provide a safe, welcoming environment where victims of domestic violence, child abuse,
elder abuse, and sexual assault can go for support and services.
Provide multi-disciplinary teams which consist of detectives, victim advocates, prosecuting
attorneys and other social service providers as appropriate. The teams will work together
to ensure client safety, help clients to access needed services and provide support for the
investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.
 “Vertically prosecute” criminal cases. “Vertical Prosecution” allows the victim to deal with
a single, prosecutor committed to handing the criminal case from start to finish.
Increase awareness and understanding of domestic violence, child abuse, elder or
dependant adult abuse, and sexual assault issues through educational programs
conducted by police detectives, victim advocates, and trained volunteers. This training
will be offered to members of the community, and “in-house” to personnel who deal with
family crimes and sexual assault cases. The programs will focus on prevention of abuse,
and prosecution of cases.
Prevent and fight domestic abuse, neglect, and exploitation of at-risk children, elder &
disabled adults in the City of Anaheim though public awareness programs designed to
